# Random Image - Canva App

Built from the **Apps SDK starter kit** for Canva's app development platform. ðŸŽ‰

## Requirements

- Node.js `v18` or `v20.10.0`
- npm `v9` or `v10`

**Note:** To make sure you're running the correct version of Node.js, we recommend using a version manager, such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro). The [.nvmrc](/.nvmrc) file in the root directory of this repo will ensure the correct version is used once you run `nvm install`.

This app just simply pulls an image from Unsplash and provides it to the GUI for you to add at a fixed 1920x1080. Canva allows multiple scaling and cropping options so this is great for simply adding a placeholder or maybe just for some inspiration.
