# Random Image - Canva App

Built from the **Apps SDK starter kit** for Canva's app development platform. ðŸŽ‰

## Requirements

- A Canva (free) account

## How to use this app

This app just simply pulls an image from Unsplash and provides it to the GUI for you to add at a fixed 1920x1080. Canva allows multiple scaling and cropping options so this is great for simply adding a placeholder or maybe just for some inspiration.

- Find the "Random Image" app under the 'Apps' button after opening a design in Canva and click 'Open'.
- Press the Generate button to see a new image pulled from Unsplash.
- If you like what you see in the preview, click on the image and will be added to your Uploads and your design.
- Style as you please.
